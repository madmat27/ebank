# ebank
Ebanking webpage using MYSQL+PHP
--------------------------------------

Assignment by Hellenic Open University to test Full stack Development Skills.

The main idea was to create the frontend of a ebanking system, according to a mock up given to us. 
We needed to stay as close as possible to the actual layout and keep in mind that functionality and aesthetics would also
play a big part in our final grades.
Photos, logos, texts and look 'n' feel are completely custom-build. No CSS+JS framework used; all are created from scratch for this specific project.

Backend was built using MYSQL + PHP on Cloud9 platform.

To upload and use, you need to create a db in phpmyadmin. Please use file db.sql

Warning: this is a demo - not an actual ebanking page!
